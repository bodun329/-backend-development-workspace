# Backend Development Workspace

**Name:** Bryant Odunayo
**Course:** App Development  




## 1. Overview of My Backend Development Workspace
This repository serves as my central hub for all backend development projects, notes, and learning resources throughout this course. It will help me track progress, organize assignments, and build a strong foundation in backend programming.



## 2. My Learning Objectives for the Course
- Strengthen my understanding of **Git** and **version control** practices.  
- Learn to write and optimize **backend scripts** using modern programming languages.  
- Build and deploy **RESTful APIs**.  
- Manage data flow between **servers and databases**.  
- Practice **documentation** and clear commit histories to reflect professional workflows.



## 3. How I Plan to Use This Repository
I will use this workspace to:
- Store all backend projects for each unit.  
- Take notes in markdown files such as `learning-log.md` and `resources.md`.  
- Document lessons learned, challenges, and key takeaways as I progress.  
- Showcase my growth and understanding of backend development over time.



## 4. Why Version Control Matters
Version control prevents errors, supports collaboration, and protects project history.  
The 2012 Knight Capital disaster, where a single deployment mistake cost $440 million, shows the importance of tracking and maintaining clean, versioned code. Using Git ensures I can roll back mistakes, experiment safely, and deploy confidently.

# Learning Log

## My Backend Development Goals
1. Master Git and GitHub for version control.  
2. Build backend scripts that automate data processing.  
3. Learn to structure scalable APIs using REST principles.  
4. Improve understanding of server-client communication.  
5. Document my progress through detailed markdown logs.  

---

## Week 1 Reflection
- Learned the basics of Git commands and how version control prevents data loss.  
- Set up my GitHub repository and local environment.  

## Week 2 Reflection
- Practiced writing meaningful commit messages and organizing folder structures.  
- Understood how developers collaborate on shared repositories.

# Git Reference Cheat Sheet

A quick reference for commonly used Git commands.

## Basic Commands
- `git init` — Initialize a new Git repository  
- `git clone [url]` — Clone a remote repository  
- `git status` — Show current repository state  
- `git add .` — Stage all changed files  
- `git commit -m "message"` — Commit staged files with a message  
- `git log --oneline` — View commit history (short form)

## Working with Remote Repositories
- `git push` — Upload commits to remote  
- `git pull` — Download and merge changes  
- `git remote -v` — Show connected remote repositories

## Branching
- `git branch` — List branches  
- `git branch [name]` — Create new branch  
- `git checkout [name]` — Switch branches  
- `git merge [branch]` — Merge branch into current one  

## Undoing & Fixing
- `git restore [file]` — Undo changes in a file  
- `git reset --hard [commit-id]` — Roll back to a previous commit  
- `git diff` — View unstaged changes
# Unit 02: Version Control

This unit covers the fundamentals of Git and GitHub, including:
- Creating repositories  
- Making commits  
- Branching and merging  
- Collaborating with others through pull requests  
# Unit 03: Backend Scripting

In this unit, I’ll learn to:
- Write backend logic using programming languages like JavaScript or Python.  
- Handle input, output, and data flow in server-side applications.  
- Connect scripts with APIs and databases.  
# Unit 04: Advanced Scripting

Topics include:
- File system operations  
- Asynchronous programming  
- Error handling and debugging  
- Writing modular and reusable code  
# Unit 05: RESTful APIs

This unit focuses on:
- Designing and building RESTful APIs  
- Understanding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)  
- Testing APIs using Postman  
- Handling authentication and routes securely
